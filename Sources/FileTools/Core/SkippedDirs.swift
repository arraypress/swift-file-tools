//  The set of "noise" directory names (version-control metadata, build output,
//  dependency caches) that scanners should skip when walking a project tree.
//  Matching is by NAME, so the list is configurable: a project with a real
//  `dist/` or `build/` source directory must be able to get it back.

/// A shared, configurable set of directory names that file scanners ignore.
///
/// These are the usual noise folders — version-control metadata, package
/// managers, build output and caches — that you almost never want to descend
/// into when searching or rendering a project's structure.
///
/// ```swift
/// if SkippedDirs.names.contains(url.lastPathComponent) { continue }
/// ```
///
/// Matching is by name, not by path, so the defaults are a heuristic rather
/// than a fact: a project that keeps real sources in `dist/` or `build/` would
/// lose them from every scan. Assign ``names`` to override the list, and
/// ``resetToDefault()`` to restore ``defaultNames``:
///
/// ```swift
/// SkippedDirs.names = SkippedDirs.defaultNames.subtracting(["dist"])
/// SkippedDirs.resetToDefault()
/// ```
///
/// - Important: ``names`` is global mutable state read by every scan in this
///   module (``FileTree`` and ``ProjectSearch``). Set it once during start-up,
///   before any scan runs, rather than mutating it concurrently with a walk.
